# Data Modelling

The details of the course and learning outcomes:

**Introduction to Data Modeling**
 - Understand the purpose of data modeling
 - Identify the strengths and weaknesses of different types of databases and data storage techniques
 - Create a table in Postgres and Apache Cassandra

**Relational Data Models**
 - Understand when to use a relational database
 - Understand the difference between OLAP and OLTP databases
 - Create normalized data tables
