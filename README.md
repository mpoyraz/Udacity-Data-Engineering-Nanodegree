# Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree
This repo contains my projects submissions for [Data Engineering Nanodegree by Udaciy](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027).

## Courses
The nanodegree consists of 4 courses:
  1. [Relational and NoSQL Data Modeling](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L1-Data-Modelling)
  2. [Cloud Data Warehouses](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L2-Cloud-Data-Warehouses)
  3. [Spark and Data Lakes](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L3-Data-Lakes-With-Spark)
  4. [Data Pipelines with Airflow](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L4-Data-Pipelines-With-Airflow)

## Projects
I completed the following 5 course projects in the nanodegree:
 1. [Relational Data Modelling with Postgres](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L1-Data-Modelling/P1-Data-Modelling-With-Postgres)
 2. [NoSQL Data Modelling with Cassandra](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L1-Data-Modelling/P2-Data-Modelling-With-Cassandra)
 3. [Data Warehousing with AWS Redshift](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L2-Cloud-Data-Warehouses/P3-Data-Warehousing-With-Redshift)
 4. [Data Lake with Spark](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L3-Data-Lakes-With-Spark/P4-Data-Lake-With-Spark)
 5. [Data Pipelines with Airflow](https://github.com/mpoyraz/Udacity-Data-Engineering-Nanodegree/tree/master/L4-Data-Pipelines-With-Airflow/P5-Data-Pipelines-With-Airflow)

## Capstone Project
At the end of the nanodegree, I worked on and implemented [Trending TV Shows](https://github.com/mpoyraz/trending-tv-shows), a fun data engineering project to identify and track popular TV shows based on tweets and [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) website.
